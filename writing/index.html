                    <p>ESP is a database where suppliers and distributors of promotional products can search for bulk items. I analyzed years worth of data using R and found that keywords related to LGBTQ+ and Pride-related items have declined since 2023, aligning with a broader corporate pullback from outward support of Pride-month events. I spoke with industry professionals as well as experts and LGBTQ+ rights activists for this story.</p>

                    <p>I analyzed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about egg prices to localize a national issue stemming from avian influenza. This story was picked up by dozens of local news outlets, including the Baltimore Banner and Maryland Matters.</p>

                    <p>I used Python to scrape news articles under ASI's sustainability tab to determine how many of the top 40 suppliers and distributors of promotional products release annual sustainability reports. I found that close to one third of all top promo firms release these types of reports, and that a majority only started releasing them in 2022, which reflects a growing trend of corporate ESG and sustainability transparency.</p>
