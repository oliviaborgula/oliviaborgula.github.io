                    <p>ESP is a database where suppliers and distributors of promotional products can search for bulk items. I analyzed years worth of data using R and found that keywords related to LGBTQ+ and Pride-related items have declined since 2023, aligning with a broader corporate pullback from outward support of Pride-month events. I spoke with industry professionals as well as experts and LGBTQ+ rights activists for this story.</p>

                    <p>I used Python to scrape news articles under ASI's sustainability tab to determine how many of the top 40 suppliers and distributors of promotional products release annual sustainability reports. I found that close to one third of all top promo firms release these types of reports, and that a majority only started releasing them in 2022, which reflects a growing trend of corporate ESG and sustainability transparency.</p>

Though fewer than a quarter of promo pros are using generative AI for artwork or video generation, expect that number to grow as deep learning models become more sophisticated. Still, many warn against the technology’s practical limitations and ethical issues.                    </p>
